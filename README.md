##Summary
This **README.md** file along with its **CodeBook.md**, **runanalysis.r** are the documentation necessary to create a tidy data output file, **TidyData.txt**. These are the files necessary to complete the final project for Coursera class "Getting and Cleaning Data."

##Notes
**CodeBook.md** details steps taken to transform the source data into the output text file, **TidyData.txt**. The rationale for each step taken is explained and supporting links provided, where appropriate. In addition, **CodeBook.md** describes all the variables in **TidyData.txt** and the file's output format.

As detailed in **CodeBook.md**, the script cleans data, merges and tidies it and then writes a tidy data text file that meets the definition of Tidy Data detailed in [Hadley Wickham's Tidy Data paper](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). The script cleans the data and solves the tidy data problem: feature column headings are values, not variables. 

The R file, run_analysis.r, was created using Version 0.98.1091 – © 2009-2014 RStudio, Inc. on a MacBookPro with the following specifications: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/600.2.5 (KHTML, like Gecko).
